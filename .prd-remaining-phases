Expected Duration: 8 hours
Blocking: Phase 3.8

PHASE 3.8: PARALLEL OPERATIONS SETUP (DUAL-SYSTEM ROUTING)
=========================================================
Status: DEPENDENT ON PHASE 3.7
Steps:
  [8.1] Set old systems to read-only
  [8.3] Create change sync Friday → Moonlanding
  [8.4] Create change sync MWR → Moonlanding
  [8.2] Set up dual-system routing
  [8.5] Monitor data consistency
  [8.6] Test rollback from Moonlanding
  [8.7] Document dual-system operation
Expected Duration: 3 hours
Blocking: Phase 3.9

PHASE 3.9: PRODUCTION CUTOVER
============================
Status: DEPENDENT ON PHASE 3.8
Steps:
  [9.1] Set old systems to read-only (final)
  [9.2] Verify no pending changes
  [9.3] Run final sync old → new
  [9.4] Verify all data current
  [9.5] Switch routing to Moonlanding (production traffic)
  [9.6] Verify system operation under load
  [9.7] Decommission old systems
  [9.8] Celebrate Phase 3 completion
Expected Duration: 2 hours
Blocking: Phase 3.10

PHASE 3.10: POST-MIGRATION SUPPORT (24H MONITORING)
==================================================
Status: DEPENDENT ON PHASE 3.9
Steps:
  [10.1] Monitor error logs (24h)
  [10.2] Address user issues immediately
  [10.3] Optimize performance if needed
  [10.4] Create migration documentation
  [10.5] Archive old system data
  [10.6] Update runbooks
  [10.7] Train support team
Expected Duration: 4 hours (+ 24h monitoring)

EXECUTION FLOW:
Phase 3.5 → Phase 3.6 → Phase 3.7 → Phase 3.8 → Phase 3.9 → Phase 3.10

TOTAL PLANNED TIME:
- Phase execution: ~23 hours
- 24h monitoring: 1 day
- Total: ~2 days of intensive execution + 1 day monitoring

SUCCESS CRITERIA (ALL MUST PASS):
- Phase 3.5: 100% validator pass rate on 10% sample
- Phase 3.6: 100% record count match on full migration
- Phase 3.7: All 12 verification checks passed
- Phase 3.8: Dual-system operation stable
- Phase 3.9: Production cutover successful, zero downtime
- Phase 3.10: 24h monitoring complete, zero critical issues

CRITICAL FEATURES TO VERIFY:
✓ PDF coordinates preserved (±0 pixels - Phase 3.5 & 3.7)
✓ User deduplication (10-15% overlap - Phase 3.7)
✓ Timestamp normalization (UTC ISO 8601 - Phase 3.5)
✓ File path updates (Friday → Moonlanding - Phase 3.5)
✓ Referential integrity (no orphans - Phase 3.7)
✓ Performance baseline (p95 <500ms - Phase 3.7)

CURRENT STATUS:
Phase 3.5 Script Ready: /home/user/lexco/moonlanding/execute-phase-3.5-real.js
Phase 3.5 Status: Ready to Execute
All Infrastructure: COMPLETE (phases 3.1-3.4 done)

NEXT STEP: Execute Phase 3.5 immediately
