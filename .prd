# FEATURE PARITY & DATA MIGRATION PRD
# Complete transformation of Moonlanding to achieve 100% feature parity with Friday-staging + MyWorkReview-staging
# Target: Configuration-driven, RippleUI-based, WebJSX-powered, hot-reloadable, state-synchronized system

## DEPENDENCY GRAPH LEGEND
# [WAVE N] = Parallel execution wave number
# BLOCKS: [item-id, ...] = Items that cannot start until this completes
# BLOCKED_BY: [item-id, ...] = Items that must complete before this starts
# Items in same wave with no dependencies execute in parallel via multiple gm subagents

## WAVE 2: COMPLETED
# All 5 items complete. Outputs: wave-2.1-friday-gap-analysis.json, wave-2.2-mwr-gap-analysis.md, wave-2.3-overlap-analysis.json, wave-2.4-architecture-gaps.json, wave-2.5-rippleui-framework.json

## WAVE 3: COMPLETED
# All 4 items complete. master-config.yml updated with Friday gaps (3.1), MWR gaps (3.2), duplication consolidated (3.3), 12 new WebJSX components created (3.4).

## WAVE 4: COMPLETED
# All 8 items complete. 30 new API endpoints, 18 new UI files, unified implementation (4.5), enhanced hot reload (4.6), WebJSX+RippleUI conversion (4.7+4.8). Commit: 53c0ae2

## WAVE 5: COMPLETED
# All 10 items complete. State sync (5.1), rendering optimization (5.2), error handling (5.3), validation (5.4), testing infrastructure (5.5), DB optimization (5.6), audit logging (5.7), monitoring (5.8), bundle optimization (5.9), accessibility (5.10). Commit: a4a599f
