MOONLANDING: REMOVE ALL TEST AUTOMATION INFRASTRUCTURE
======================================================

OBJECTIVE: Remove all unit test frameworks, test files, playwright automation, and test dependencies. Keep application code intact. Retain only manual testing evidence.

DEPENDENCIES GRAPH:
- [1] Find all test files → blocks [2]
- [2] Delete test files → blocks [4]
- [3] Find test deps in package.json → blocks [4]
- [4] Remove test deps and scripts → blocks [5]
- [5] Find test config files → blocks [6]
- [6] Delete test configs → blocks [7]
- [7] Clean docs of test refs → blocks [8]
- [8] Verify cleanup complete → blocks [9]
- [9] Git commit and push → FINAL

INDEPENDENT ITEMS (CAN PARALLELIZE):
Wave 1 (parallel):
  [1.1] Find .test.js files recursively
  [1.2] Find .test.ts files recursively
  [1.3] Find .spec.js files recursively
  [1.4] Find .spec.ts files recursively
  [1.5] Find test/ directories recursively
  [1.6] Find __tests__/ directories recursively
  [1.7] Find tests/ directories recursively
  [1.8] Find playwright.config.js files
  [1.9] Find test-browser-workflows.mjs files
  [1.10] Find execute-all-workflows.js files
  [1.11] Find run-workflows.sh files
  [1.12] Find jest.config.js files
  [1.13] Find vitest.config.js files
  [1.14] Find mocha.opts files
  [1.15] Find karma.conf.js files
  [1.16] Find .testcoveragerc files
  [1.17] Find nyc.config.js files
  [1.18] Find .nycrc files

Wave 2 (after Wave 1 - sequential deletion):
  [2.1] Delete all test files found in Wave 1
  [2.2] Delete all test config files found in Wave 1
  [2.3] Remove test dependencies from package.json
  [2.4] Remove test scripts from package.json

Wave 3 (after Wave 2 - documentation cleanup):
  [3.1] Find all markdown files with test references
  [3.2] Remove test running instructions from docs
  [3.3] Remove test coverage badges
  [3.4] Remove test setup documentation
  [3.5] Keep manual testing documentation only

Wave 4 (after Wave 3 - verification):
  [4.1] Verify no .test.js files remain
  [4.2] Verify no .spec.js files remain
  [4.3] Verify no test directories remain
  [4.4] Verify package.json has no test deps
  [4.5] Verify npm install succeeds
  [4.6] List remaining files

Wave 5 (after Wave 4 - git operations):
  [5.1] Stage all deletions
  [5.2] Create commit
  [5.3] Push to main
  [5.4] Verify push succeeded

STATUS: READY TO EXECUTE - WAVE 1 NEXT
