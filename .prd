## REMAINING WORK

All non-migration items are COMPLETE. Remaining items (6.1-6.7, 7.1-7.8) are BLOCKED pending
availability of external staging systems:
- /home/user/lexco/friday-staging (Firebase Firestore)
- /home/user/lexco/myworkreview-staging (Firebase Firestore)

When staging systems become available, execute phases 3.5-3.10 per CLAUDE.md instructions.

## EXECUTION SUMMARY

Non-migration waves (2-5, 6.8-6.16, 7.9-7.17): ALL COMPLETE
Migration waves (6.1-6.7, 7.1-7.8): BLOCKED - external staging systems unavailable

System status: PRODUCTION-READY for non-migration functionality.
